    <p><b>Bangladesh is one of the world's most desnsly-populated countries,with its people living in a delta of rivers that empty  into the Bay of Bangla.</b> <br>
        proverty is widedpread, but Bangladesh has in recent years reduced population growth and improved health and education. <br>
        Formeerly East Pakistan, Bangladesh came into bening only in 1971, when the two parts of Pakistan split after a bitter  war which drew in neighbourning India. <br>
        Bangladesh spent 15 years under military rule and, although democracy was restored in 1990, the political scene remains volatile. Islamist extremism has also been rising in the traditionally tolerant country.

        Bangladesh is low-lying and vulnerable to flooding and cyclones. It stands to be badly affected by any rise in sea levels.
